# Welcome to My Resume Repository! ðŸ‘‹

This repository serves as a central location for my up-to-date resumes. I keep my resume updated here, so you can always find the latest version.

## Why Check the Releases? ðŸ¤”

Instead of directly modifying the main branch, I package my resumes as releases. This ensures:

-   **Version Control:** You always know which version you're looking at.
-   **Stability:** The main branch remains clean, while releases provide stable versions of my resume.
-   **Easy Access:** You can quickly download the resume in various formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.).

## How to Find My Resumes ðŸš€

1.  Click on the "Releases" tab in this repository.
2.  Browse the release history to find the version you're interested in.
3.  Download the resume in your preferred format from the assets attached to each release.

## Stay Updated! ðŸ“£

I regularly update my resume, so be sure to check the releases frequently for the latest version!
